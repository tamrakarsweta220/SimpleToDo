## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. Initially, I was not able to create a virtual device on Android Studio. After trouble shooting for a bit, I realized that it was because I didn't have enough space on my computer.
Once I deleted some files and had more space, I was able to create a virtual device and run the emulator smoothly.
2. I have never worked with Kotlin before, so I was a little nervous about creating the app in Kotlin. However, as I continued building the app, I realized that it seemed very similar to 
Java and because I have programmed in Java before, I became more confident about implementing the program.
